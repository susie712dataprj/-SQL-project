## Introduction
My first practice with SQL to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a "small" Ecommerce dataset aimed at analyzing customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance. During this process, I focused on extracting key metrics such as total sales, average order value, and customer lifetime value. I also segmented the data to understand which product categories were most popular and which time periods saw the highest traffic. Through the use of various SQL queries, I was able to identify patterns and insights that could inform strategic decisions for optimizing marketing efforts and inventory management.
